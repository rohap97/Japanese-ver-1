This is an Android App built with the help of education acquired from the Google India Scholarship Challenge. This Scholarship allowed me to learn how to code Android Apps. WIth the help of this scholarship I was able to develop this App. This app contains various day-to-day phrases that will help in easy communication with any Japanese person, be it a friend or a foreigner or even a stranger. This app is a sample app. I will add more phrases in the near future.
